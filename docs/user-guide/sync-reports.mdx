As a BI Hub user you can trigger sync reports from your user profile.
This sync reports operation initiates a sync for only the reports that are mapped for your user profile in the BI Platform.

:::note
If **Sync Reports** button is not visible in your navigation panel, kindly contact your BI Hub admin to enable this option.
:::

Select **Sync Reports** from the bottom of the Navigation Panel.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="User Settings Page" height="600" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/reports/nav-panel-sync-reports.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>User Settings Page</p>
  </div>

Once the sync is completed, a pop-up notification indicates the status of the sync.

You can also view sync details by selecting Notifications ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('img/bell.png')} /> ) icon at the top right-corner of your screen.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="User Notifications" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/reports/sync-reports.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Sync reports notification</p>
  </div>

Select a completed sync.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Sync Summary" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/reports/user-sync-report-summary.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Sync reports summary with added/revoked reports</p>
  </div>

The **Sync Summary** pop-up window displays a list of granted and revoked reports.

> Only the users mapped to your username will be synched from the BI Platform into the BI Hub application.

:::important
The number of user sync reports process that can run concurrently depends on the value (x) set by the admin.

If the maximum number of allowed user sync reports is exceeded, the next sync request will be in queue.

As the initial sync reports are completed, the next queued requests will be taken in ( x reports buffered at a time ) and completed.
