All the report(s) that you have added as Favorites appear in this section.

You can select the reports from different sections like **Dashboard/My Folders/Hub Folders/BI Platform/History** and select the Favorite ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('/img/favorites.png')} /> ) icon next to (on) the report.

This provides you a handy list of important reports.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Favorites" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/favorites.png')}/>
  </Zoom>
  <p></p>
</div>

To move any of the favorite report(s), select the report(s) and then select **Add To My Folders**.

In the **My Folders** pane on the right, select the folder and then add **Add Here**.

Your favorite report(s) will now also appear in the **My Folders** section under the folder that you chose.

To remove a report(s) from the favorites list, click on the Favorite ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('/img/red-favorite.png')} /> ) icon next to the report(s).

The un-favorite report will no longer be listed in this section, however you can still view the report from other sections in the BI Hub application.
