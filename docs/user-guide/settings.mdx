    </Zoom>
    <p>User Settings Page</p>
  </div>

## Profile

In the Profile section, you can edit your email id, division and edit/delete the user profile photo.

> You cannot edit the username.

* **Open Report in new tab**: If enabled, the reports will open in a new tab in the browser. This setting is Off by default.
When the user enables this setting, that takes precedence over the default one.
* **Email Notification**: If enabled, you will receive the notifications in email.
* **In-App Notification**: If enabled, the notifications will pop-up with in the BI Hub application.

## Authorize Agents

As an additional security measure, some of the agents in BI Hub platform have been configured with both admin and user side authentication.

You can only access the reports for the listed agents in this section once you validate your sign-in credentials.
Select **Login** next to the agent(s).

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="MS sign-in" width="400" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/agent/ms-sign-in.jpg')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Microsoft Sign-in screen</p>
  </div>

Enter the user mapping credentials for the agent.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Powerbi agent Login Credentials" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-mode/rw4.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Success credential verification screen</p>
  </div>

### Troubleshooting

If there is a mismatch in the platform user mapping and the user credentials, then the below authentication error will be shown:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="agent Login failed" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/agent/auth-failure.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Check the Microsoft Office login credentials for any other user log-in.
You must log out the other user and sign-in as your logged-in user credentials.

If you are still unable to sign-in, please contact your BI Hub admin.
