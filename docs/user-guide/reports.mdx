You can only view the reports from the BI platform that admin has given you the access to.

These reports can be categorized based on different parameters in various sections such as: **Favorites, My Folders, Hub Folder, BI Platform**, and **History**.

All the reports have some general attributes and some common actions that you can perform on the reports from any section.

## Report's Display view

You can change the display of reports to List or tiles view.

* List view: Default view.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Default list view" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/list-view.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

* Large tiles display the report's thumbnail along with report's action items.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Large Tiles View" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/cf14.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

* Small tiles display all the report's action items except for the thumbnail.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Small Tiles View" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/cf15.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

## Report's Column Headers

You can select the Column Headers to be displayed by selecting the Columns ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('img/filter-cols.png')} /> ) icon at the top right corner.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Column Filter" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/cf31.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

The drop-down list includes a list of custom attributes.

**Name** and **Actions** are the only default columns that cannot be hidden.

1. **Name**: Name of the Report
1. **Actions**: The actions that you can perform on the reports as mentioned in the below sections.

By default, the following report fields are displayed:

1. **Views**: Number of times the report has been viewed by you and other users.
1. **Instance Name**: Agent's instance name the report belongs to.
1. **Folder Path**: BI Hub platform location where the report is stored.

> To filter the column headers check/uncheck the highlighted drop-down menu.

### Filter and Sort Reports

* To display selected reports, use the filter ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('img/filter.png')} /> ) icon next to the column(s).
* To sort the reports in ascending/descending order click on the up/down arrow on the column name.
* To re-arrange the column order, hold and drag the columns.

> You cannot reorder the **Name** column, this column is always the first column by default.

## User Actions on the report

### Sharepoint reports version history

  </div>

Following are the actions that you can perform on the versioned documents:

* **View**: View report's changes made in that specific version history.
* **Restore**: Revert back to the chosen version.
* **Delete**: Delete a version. You cannot delete the latest version but the previous ones.
  <div class="center">

      <img alt="Version history logs" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/version-history-logs.png')} />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Version history logs</p>
  </div>

For the versioned docs, you can view information such as the **Version number, Modified (date), Modified By (name), Size (file), Comments**, and report's metadata.
