This section explains how to request permission to view the Inaccessible reports.

Search for the report(s) and select the **Inaccessible** tab. Select the report(s) and then select **Request Access**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Request Access" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/rq1.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Request Access on the report(s)</p>
  </div>

You can chose to enter appropriate comments to the admin for request approval.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Request Access Window" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/rq2.png')} width="350" />
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Once you raise the request, it triggers both a notification pop-up and an access request mail notification to admin.
Once the admin approves/rejects your request, a similar access notification mail will be sent to you as well. A similar message also pops-up on your screen.

You can also view a list of all the requests raised by you under <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/user-guide/home-page/my-requests')}>My Requests</Link> section.
