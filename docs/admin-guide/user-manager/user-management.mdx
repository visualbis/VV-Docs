  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add User option" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/user-manager/add-user.png')}/>
    </Zoom>

 <p>Add User</p>
  </div>

* Enter **Fullname**, and select:
  * **Native** to add a user who will be authenticated by BI Hub (because the user is currently authenticated by BI platforms and not AD).
  OR
  * **Windows AD** to add a user who will be authenticated by Windows AD.
* Click **Continue**.
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Select Agent(s)" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/user-manager/select-agent.png')}/>
    </Zoom>

 <p>Select Agent(s)</p>
  </div>

* Select the agent to be added for the user and the corresponding username. Click **Add** to include more agents.
* Click **Submit** when you are finished adding the agent(s).

> The added user will be reflected in the User Manager's list.

To synchronize reports for this user, one of the following actions can be performed:

* Wait till the next scheduled synchronization activity happens, or
* Follow steps in Section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-reports')}>Synchronize Reports of Users</Link> to Sync Reports with a single click, or
* Manually add reports to the user using User Manager as explained in section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/user-manager/user-management#add-reports-to-an-existing-user')}>Add Reports to an existing user</Link>.

### Add Users from other BI Platforms

An Admin can map users who have different user names across BI Platforms into one BI Hub user as follows:

* Go to **User Manager**.

> The users added previously (either from Section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-users-between-agent-and-bi-hub')}>Synchronize Users between Agent and BI Hub</Link> or <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/authenticate/synch-ms-ad-bihub')}>Synchronize Microsoft AD users with BI Hub</Link>) will be listed.

* Select the user and click **Edit**, and then click **Add**.
  * From the drop-down list boxes, select the appropriate **Agent** name and **User** name. ( To search a user name, start typing the name in the drop-down box. )
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Edit User" height="400" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/edit-user.jpg')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Edit User</p>
  </div>
* Click **Update**.

* Now the BI Hub user chosen in the **User Manager** page has been mapped to the user name from the BI platform. Repeat the steps until users of all BI platforms are mapped.
Next, proceed with the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-reports')}>Synchronize reports of Users</Link> section.

## Edit the Password of BI Hub (Native) authenticated user

* In the **Edit User** screen, click the **Authentication** tab and expand the **Native** option. Enter a new password and click **Update**.

    </Zoom>

 <p>Reset Native user Password</p>
  </div>

An email notification is triggered to the user with the new password.
When the user logs in to the BI Hub application, the user will be prompted to change the password that was reset by BI Hub admin.

:::important
If admin syncs the reports from the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-reports')}>Agent Manager</Link> section, then the reports selected here will be over-ridden by all the reports.

    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Assigning Reports" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/user-manager/assigningreports.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Once you complete the reports assignment, a message pops up on the screen: "Action Completed Successfully".
:::

Click **Back** to assign/unassign reports for the other agents against the same user.

### Next Steps

To complete the manual assignment of reports to BI Hub, select **User Manager > Sync Metadata**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Sync Metadata" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/maintenance-bihub/syncmetadata.jpg')}/>

### Troubleshooting

1. If there are no **Unassigned Reports** listed in the left-hand side panel, contact your Platform admin for report access.
If the reports are still not visible, kindly contact the BI Hub Support Team by raising a ticket in the support portal or by sending an email to support@bihub.com.

1. To access the reports for OneDrive and sharePoint agents, users must also verify their login credentials under the User Settings page.

1. If the Agent is down/inactive, the Reports cannot be retrieved. An Alert Message is displayed as shown below:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Reports in disabled status" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/maintenance-bihub/alert1.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Reports in disabled status</p>
  </div>

  You must <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#start-the-instance')}>Start the Instance</Link> from the **Agent Manager** screen.
