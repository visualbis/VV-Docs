    </Zoom>

 <p>Add User</p>
  </div>

* Enter **Fullname**, and select:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Select Agent(s)" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/user-manager/select-agent.png')}/>

> The added user will be reflected in the User Manager's list.

In order to synchronize reports for this user, one of the following actions can be performed:

* Wait till the next scheduled synchronization activity happens, or
* Follow steps in Section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-reports')}>Synchronize Reports of Users</Link> to Sync Reports with a single click, or

### Add Users from other BI Platforms

An Admin can map users who have different user names across BI Platforms into one BI Hub user as follows:

* Go to **User Manager**.

> The users added previously (either from Section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/agent-manager/agent/agent-management#sync-users-between-agent-and-bi-hub')}>Synchronize Users between Agent and BI Hub</Link> or <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/authenticate/synch-ms-ad-bihub')}>Synchronize Microsoft AD users with BI Hub</Link>) will be listed.

* Select the user and click **Edit**, and then click **Add**.
  * From the drop-down list boxes, select the appropriate **Agent** name and **User** name. ( To search a user name, start typing the name in the drop-down box. )
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Edit User" height="400" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/edit-user.jpg')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Edit User</p>
  </div>
* Click **Update**.

* Now the BI Hub user chosen in the **User Manager** page has been mapped to the user name from the BI platform. Repeat the steps until users of all BI platforms are mapped.

:::important

### Next Steps

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Sync Metadata" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/maintenance-bihub/syncmetadata.jpg')}/>

### Troubleshooting

1. If there are no **Unassigned Reports** listed in the left-hand side panel, contact your Platform admin for report's access.
If the reports are still not visible, kindly contact the BI Hub Support Team by raising a ticket in the support portal or by sending an email to support@bihub.com.

1. To access the reports for Onedrive and sharepoint agents, users must also verify their login credentials under User Settings page.

1. If the Agent is down/inactive, the Reports cannot be retrieved. An Alert Message is displayed as shown below:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Reports in disabled status" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/maintenance-bihub/alert1.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Reports in disabled status</p>
  </div>
