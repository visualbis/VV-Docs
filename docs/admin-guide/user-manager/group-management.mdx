BI Hub admin must create few Power Users who can perform some predefined activities similar to the Admin user.
To do so, Admin must first create a customized User Group and enable some admin permissions. Then add users to this User Group.

## Manage User Groups

In the **User Manager** screen, select **Manage User Groups**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Manage User Groups" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/pr1.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

### Add a new User Group

Click **Add User Group**.
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add User Group" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/add-user-group.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Enter a name for the User Group and click **Create**.

### Manage Permissions

Select the User Group and click **Manage Permissions**.
  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Manage Users Groups screen" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/select-user-group.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Enable the access for specific tasks in both **REPORT ADMINISTRATION** and **SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION** sections.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Manage User Groups" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/pr5.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

Assign the required **DASHBOARD ADMINISTRATION** permissions:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Manage Users Groups screen" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/sys-dashboard-admin-permissions.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Dashboard admin settings</p>
  </div>

* **Dashboard Admin**: As a Dashboard Admin, the Power User will have access rights similar to that of Admin for managing both the Dashboard Settings and Custom Dashboard (Refer <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/settings/user-dashboard')}>Section: User Dashboard</Link>).
* **Dashboard Manager**: The Power User can manage only the Dashboards created by all the Users and cannot configure the Dashboard settings.
( Refer <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/settings/user-dashboard#custom-dashboard')}>Custom Dashboard</Link> section ).
* **Dashboard Creator**: As a Dashboard Creator, the Power User do not have the access rights for managing both the Dashboard Settings and Custom Dashboard. Instead, Power User can only create and manage Dashboard for the self profile.
* **None**: No Dashboard Administration settings are visible.

:::note
Reports for which the Power User has access in the User Mode will be live loaded and the Reports for which the Power User has no access in the User Mode will be shown as default thumbnail reports.

    </Zoom>
    <p>Add users to the User Group</p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="User Groups" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/power-users/power-users-added.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Users added to the User Group</p>
  </div>

### Edit User Group

Select a User Group and click **Edit**. This allows you to rename a User Group and click **Save**.
