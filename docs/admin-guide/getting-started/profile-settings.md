To edit BI Hub admin's profile settings, hover over your profile icon on the top-right corner of the screen.
In the **Profile Settings** screen, you can manage your profile picture, email address, and division/department to which the administrator belongs to.

These attributes are accepted when the administrator does a login for the first time along with the Change Password page.

> Email ID is mandatory. (This email address is used in the 'Access Requests' generated by the user in the Smart Search feature as the From address. However, "To:" email address is the address specified in the Agent instance, and the user gets a copy of the request.)
>
> The Profile picture must be in `.jpg` format, and the recommended size is `584 X 400` px.

BI Hub administrator can modify the email address, division, and Profile picture using the Profile Settings.
