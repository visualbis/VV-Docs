As an admin you can view important application notifications by selecting the Notifications ( <img width="25" src={useBaseUrl('img/bell.png')} /> ) icon at the top right-corner of your screen.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Notifications" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-notifications.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Notifications and settings</p>
  </div>

The Notifications side panel has two tabs:

1. Notifications

  This section lists agent(s) down and user's request access on the report.

1. Settings

  Allows you to enable/disable **Email notification** and **In app notification** for all BI Hub users. These settings decide if the users would receive platform related information (alert/warning/information) in an email or as a pop-up message in the application or both.
