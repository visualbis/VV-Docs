In addition to classifying the reports by platform, you can also classify the reports functionally by using the **Hub Folders** from within the BI Hub application.

### Add a new Hub Folder

* In the **Reports** section, select the **Hub Folders** tab.
* Select **+ Add**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Hub Folders" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/add-hub-folder.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

* In **ADD FOLDER** pop-up window, enter a folder's name and select **Add**.

You can add multiple Hub folders and they will all be listed on the Hub Folders page.

Next, select the reports (or folders) from the **Platform Folders** section and select <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/reports/platform-folder#add-to-hub-folders')}>Add to Hub Folder</Link>.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Hub Folders list" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/new-folders-in-hub.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Hub Folder(s) added from Platform Folders</p>
  </div>

### Move Hub Folder/report

To move a Hub Folder or report(s) from one location to another, select the Folder(s)/report(s).
Select **Move To**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Hub Folders Move to" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/move-to.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Move Hub Folders to another Folder</p>
  </div>

Select another Hub Folder path and then select **Add Here**.

### Rename a Hub Folder

To rename a Hub Folder(s), select the name of the Hub Folder and select **Rename**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Rename Hub Folders" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/hub-folder-edits.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

You can only rename the folder name and not a report.

### Delete a Hub Folder

Select the Hub Folder/report and select **Delete**.
The folders/reports will no longer be visible in the Hub Folders section.

However, the folders/reports will not be deleted from the Platform.
