The reports are initially added by a Server admin from the backend into the BI Platform. The Server admin then manages groups/users and assigns reports access to them.

### Add To Hub Folders

You can classify the reports in 2 ways:

1. Navigate to the listed Platform folders, and select **Add to Hub Folders**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add to Hub Folders" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/add-platform-folders.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Select and add reports to Hub Folders</p>
  </div>

1. Search for the reports across all the platforms, and select **Add to Hub Folders**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Search and add to Hub Folders" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/search-move-to-hub.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Search and add reports to Hub Folders</p>
  </div>

From the list of already added Hub Folders, select the location you want to move the reports to.
Select **Add Here**.

### Upload Report's Metadata using `csv`

In addition to classifying reports functionally, you can upload metadata of the reports in `.csv` format.
The screenshot below, displays the list of metadata attributes:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Report's metadata attributes" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/reports/metadata-csv.png')} width="900" />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Report's metadata attributes</p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Sample CSV File" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rp6.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Hub Folders column denotes the Hub Folders path in BI Hub</p>
  </div>

* To upload your report's metadata, select **Upload**.
* Navigate to the `.csv` file and select **Open**.

### Download Metadata

You can download the metadata of a single report or multiple report(s).

* Select the report(s) and select **Download**.

This extracts all the attributes of the reports to a CSV file which can be updated by the administrator with the help of business owners and administrators of those BI platforms.

:::note
You can edit the Hub Folders location path of the reports by editing the "Hub Folder" column in the `.csv` file.

If the folder is available in Hub Folders Tab, then the reports are moved into that folder. If the Hub Folder does not exist, a folder will be created in that name and the reports will be placed under that folder.
:::

### Sync Metadata

You can also import metadata for the selected reports only from the BI Platform into BI Hub.
To do so, select the reports and then select **Sync Metadata**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Sync Metadata" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rp8.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Sync Metadata for the selected reports</p>
  </div>

### Report Details

To view more details of any report, navigate to the report's path and select the details icon ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/details-icon.png')} /> ) next to the report.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Report Details Pane" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rp9.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Report Details fetched from BI Platform</p>
  </div>

### Report Thumbnails

Each report can be given a unique thumbnail to identify it easier. 
Select the upload icon ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/upload-icon.png')} /> ) next to the selected report.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Select & Upload Image" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rp10.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

In the **Image** tab, you can **Upload Image** or **Delete Image**.

The thumbnail uploaded by the admin above will get displayed for the respective report(s) when the user logs-in

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Reports Display in User Login" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rp12.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Thumbnail view of the reports in the User mode</p>
  </div>

> If there is no thumbnail uploaded for a report, then a default image will be shown.

### Custom Fields

Custom fields are the user-defined fields created by the admin to describe the reports.

Navigate to the desired report and select the Details ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/details-icon.png')} /> ) icon or the Edit ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/edit.png')} /> ) icon.

* Select **Custom Fields**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img width="400" alt="Custom Fields" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/custom-fields.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
	<p>Custom Fields</p>
  </div>

* Enter the desired value for the custom fields(attributes) and select **Submit**.

To indicate if the report is compatible with the mobile devices, set the **Mobile Enabled** attribute to **True**.

### Report's History

To view the edit history on a report, select the **History** tab in the Report's details page.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Reports History" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-functions/reports/rh1.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Edit history of a report</p>
  </div>
