Pre-Sync Reports utility is used by a Server Admin to trigger reports sync for selected agent(s)/instance(s).
This utility helps in reducing the overhead transactions made to the Server and results in an increased performance.

## Pre-requisite

The agent must be configured and in running state.

## Trigger Presync Reports

* Navigate to the Server location: `C:\Program Files\Visual BI Solutions\VBI View\VBIViewServer\utilities`.
* Click on "BI Hub Presync Operation.exe".
* Select **File > Open in command prompt > Open command prompt as administrator**.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="Admin Utilities in the Server"
        src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-utilities/admin-utilities.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Admin Utilities</p>
  </div>

* Enter the command: `BI Hub Presync Operation.exe`.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="Admin Utilities in the Server"
        src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-utilities/script-run-server.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Admin Utilities</p>
  </div>

  * The application accepts 2 arguments:
    * -a: Agent name for which the Pre-sync reports is triggered.
    * -i: Instances configured for the agent.

* Run the application as:
  
  ```xml
    BI Hub Presync Operation.exe -a Cognos
  ```

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
        <img alt="PreSync Utility in the Server"
        src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-utilities/pre-sync-running.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Pre-sync utility triggered</p>
  </div>

:::note
Agent's name is case-sensitive and must be the exact name as configured in BI Hub application.
:::

You can view the status and summary of the sync process in the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/getting-started/homepage#4-synchronization-information')}>Home Page</Link>.
The information will be listed as run by a 'bot' when triggered as a utility from the backend server.

## Troubleshooting

If the sync fails with a response code `400`, this indicates that the agent is down or inactive.

Check the agent's status in Agent Manager and start the agent's instance.
