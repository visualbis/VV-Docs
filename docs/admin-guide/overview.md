BI Hub is used for only viewing reports and it cannot be used to create/modify/delete reports. Those tasks will have to be done in the BI platform. Most of the features explained in this guide are launched from the application pane (shown below this text) after the user/admin does a successful login.

The application pane displays all the modules in this application â€“ 

- <Link to={useBaseUrl('#admin-home-page')}>Admin Home Page</Link>
- <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/admin-functions/integrate-bihub-platform-msad/edit-agent-instance')}>Agent Manager</Link>
- User manager
- Authentication
- Audit
- Reports
- User Request
- Customization

This is the same order in which the modules are displayed in the application pane as shown below. The functionality of these modules are covered in subsequent sections of this document.

### First-time Login

BI Hub administrator mode and user mode uses the same product URL and depending on the 
login (as admin or user name) appropriate modules of the application are rendered. After launching the 
product, the administrator can log into the application by entering the user ID as *vbiview*, which is the administrator login ID. A Set Admin Password screen opens up during the first login to accept a new password.
>Note that the administrator logins with the authentication type set as *Native*; 
Users login with authentication type set as *Microsoft AD/LDAP*.

### Forgot Password

If the administrator forgets his/her password or wishes to reset the password for security reasons, the Change Password utility can be used. Refer Section <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/admin-guide/admin-utilities/change-passwd')}>Change Password</Link>.
