By default,the bundled Nginx will contain the self-signed SSL certificate issued to example.com. Kindly have the proper SSL certificate from the authorized vendor in .crt format and key file. You can also have your own Self-Signed SSL certificate, but you need to make sure that certificate to a trusted certificate store by following the configuration steps provided by the particular browser which is out of scope for this document. BI Hub recommends having the proper SSL certificate from the authorized vendor.Rename the SSL files to the required names. The X.X.X.X.crt file should be renamed to server.crt file and the X.X.X.X.key file should be renamed to server.key.Take a backup of the server.crt and server.key files which could be found in the folder location <installation_folder>/VBIViewWeb/nginx/nginx/conf. In case of any failure in SSL configuration, we will need this file to bring back the server to normal working condition.Now replace these files with your SSL files.Nginx Server needs to be restarted for the configuration to take effect. For restarting the Nginx server, open manager-windows.exe file in administrator mode which could be found in the location <installation_folder>/VBIViewWeb/nginx/.Select Manage Server > Nginx and click Restart. Wait for the server to get restarted.✅ SSL is configured successfully for your BI Hub Web.noteIf there is any problem in restarting the server, check the log files for the errors which could be found at <installation_folder>/VBIViewWeb/nginx/nginx/logs/.If you couldn’t troubleshoot the errors, kindly replace the old SSL file with the new one and restart the server.If the server starts successfully, then the problem will be mostly with the SSL file. Kindly verify the SSL certificate format and have a proper SSL format.If you continue to have the problem, you could raise the support ticket in the support portal or by sending an email to support@bihub.com with supported log files and error images.importantIf you are going to configure SSL, please make sure that BI Hub Server and BI Hub Agents and its respective BI platforms should also be configured with proper SSL.
